    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "In our project, Thymio was going onn a walk in garden next to the lake when he suddenly found himself surrounded by a fire. Luckily, he was able to communicate with is bird friends to give him a top view of where the fire is and how to reach the lake from his current position. Hoowever, incase a sudden fire burst infront of him, Thymio will depend on his sensors to help replan the path.\n",
    "\n",
    "The simulation environment for testing consists of a white background, rectangular red obtsacles representing the flames the robot is attempting to avoid, a rectangular blue goal representng the water the robot wants to reach, and four ArUco markers at each corner of the map. It is worth noting that the shape of the goal and the obstacles does not matter given that the detection algorithm is based on detecting the color. The markers allow fo the dividing the map into a grid to pascilitate path planning, given that we have settled on the A* algorithm. At some instances, since the smoke of the fire would block the birds' view, the designed Kalman filter will help the Thymio navigate.\n",

    "In order organize our code we created two classes: the Map class and the Robot class. Whith these classes it is easier to organize the different attributes like map size of robot position.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Vision\n",
    "The vision part of the project consists of two main blocks hat are the ArUco markers detection and tracking, in addition to color detection. The former is utilized in order to detect and assign the corners of the map and the position of the Thymio robot, while the latter works on detecting the the two colors red and blue.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ArUco Marker Detection and Tracking\n",
    "As previously mentioned, this part of the code is responsible for detecting the ArUco markers placed on each corner of the map in additoin to the robot. ArUco markers are synthetics squares consisting of a binary matrix definig and identifier inside of a thick black border. Th detection of these markers is done using the aruco module of OpenCV, which is based on the ArUco library. The code provided below is part of the aruco.py pyhton file the group generated for the vision part of the project, and it includes the functions used to detect markers.\n"

    "The same algorithm for detecting the obstacles and the goal is used, but wth different parameters to adjust for the different colors, where the color red implies a detected obstacle and the color blue implies a detected goal. The method is used over other edge detection methods since we can easiliy limit the colored objects in the map, but we can't limit the edges, and sharp objects to just the obstacles and the goal, and then there would be the issue of differentiating between the goal and the obstacles. Hence why the team settled on coor detection. A sample of one of the codes is shown below for the blue color (goal) detection.\n"

    "\n",
    "For the global navigation, the camera to creates a grid-based map, locating Thymio as well as obstacles and the goal. Then the path is planned based on the A* algorithm. The choise of A* was made in order to frequently update the map as it less intense computationally than Dijkstra's algorythm while still compatible with our grid based map.\n",
    "\n",
    "There were some issues with the planner getting stuck in local minimas. While debugging we ended up removing the heuristic function, and the end, we ended up whith a path planning strategy more resembling a breadth first search (BFS). While BFS does not allways return the shortest path it always returns a valid path, which is more important for our puroses given our scale. \n",
    "\n",
    "In order ot take into accont Thymios dimensions there is the is_valid funciton that checks wether or not a potential node in the path is a valid option for Thymio to go to or if it is too close to an obstacle. After calculating the path, it is then broken down into the coorinates where the direction is changed and this infromation is then sent to motion control. Having the individual path points as far appart as possible facilitates the angle calculation between the Thymio and the next path point, which is needed for the motion control. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Local Navigation\n",
    "\n",
    "Our local navigation is a simple one layer neural network with the infrared sensors as the weighed inputs and the motor speed as outputs. The weights were determined using trial and errror such that if an obstacle is detected Thymio turns away from it and drives a short distance before it aligns itself again with the next path point to check if the obstacle is still in the way. As soon as the obstacle is no longer detected by the infrared sensors, it goes back to following the path. Which insures that the it doesnt get distracted with circleing the obstacle.\n",

    "\n",
    "The motion control strategy is based on the path points as mentioned above. The main idea being that Thymio turns on the spot until it faces the next point of the path and then drives in a straight line untill it reaches it. In order for this to be a smooth process there is a threshhold where if the angle is under 40°, Thymio drives and corrects the angle at the same time. \n",
