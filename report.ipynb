On the way he avoids fallen trees, while his bird friends report any new fires that occur along his journey and help him replan his path. \n",

It is worth noting that the shape of the goal and the obstacles does not matter given that the detection algorithm is based on detecting the color. The markers allow us to divide the map into a grid to fascilitate path planning, given that we have settled on the A* algorithm.

The method is used over other edge detection methods since we can easiliy limit the colored objects in the map, but we can't limit the edges, and sharp objects to just the obstacles and the goal, and then there would be the issue of differentiating between the goal and the obstacles.

    "For the global navigation, the camera creates a grid-based map, locating Thymio as well as obstacles and the goal as mentioned in the previous parts. Then the path is planned based on the `find_shortest_path()` function in the `astar_path_planning.py` python file, which is based on the A* algorithm. The choice of A* was made in order to frequently update the map as it is computationally less expensive than Dijkstra's algorythm while still compatible with our grid based map and finding the shortest path.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first iteration of the planner had the limitation of getting stuck in local minimum. This occured when obstacles were too close to one another, or they were touching the boarders of the map. Given that our map is not big, and taking into account the size of the Thymio, our planner woud frequently get stuck in local minmum, and hence required either to change the planner or improve it. So, the team chose to build on the A* algorithm by removing the heuristic function, which led to a planner more reselmbling a breadth first sarch (BFS). This meant that we had to compromise the optimality of our path over its completeness, in order to have a complete path planner. Once we realised that the results were no longer optimal, we modified our now reliable funciton to add the heuristic function back in. This results in our current planner which is a modified A*.\n",
    "\n",
    "The function `is_valid()` is then implemented to to take into account Thymio's dimensions with respect to the obstacles. The function checks wether or not a potential node in the path is a valid option for Thymio to go to or if it is too close to an obstacle. After calculating the path, it is then broken down into the coordinates where the direction is changed and this infromation is then sent to motion control. Having the individual path points as far appart as possible facilitates the angle calculation between the Thymio and the next path point, which is needed for the motion control. \n"

    "In summary, the team worked on designing a map that would be detected using a camera placed above the map. First, the vision module is called to detect the main parts of the map consisting of the fire obstacles, the water goal, and the current position of the Thymio. This module is being called at every frame in order to keep updating the position of the robot. Then a grid-based map is generated from the inputs of the camera and fed to a modified A* global path planner to generate a viable path for the robot to follow. The output of this path is passed to the motion planner to orient and direct Thymio towards his next point in the map until he finally reaches his goal. A Kalman filter module is also implemented in the event that we lose view from the camera so the robot will be able to estimate its future state based on its last known state and still manage to proceed on its path. Finally, in the case of a sudden obstacle popping up infront of the robot, a local path planner is designd to help Thymio avoid it using its own sensors rather than depending on inputs from the camera. The teting of the system showed that the different modules are able to communicate well with each other in order to generate a path to avoid the different obstacles and reach  the goal point effectively.
